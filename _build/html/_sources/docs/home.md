Life expectancy is a critical indicator of a countryâ€™s health and development. It is influenced by several factors, including socioeconomic status, healthcare quality, political stability, and environmental conditions (Freeman et al., 2020). This datastory project aims to investigate the relationship between life expectancy and various factors across different income groups, using two World Bank datasets from Kaggle.

**perspective 1: The political stability factors associated with life expectancy in a country do not show a similar correlation for all income groups.**

The first perspective looks at political stability and its different impacts on life expectancy across income groups. Political stability can improve health policies and resource distribution, leading to better health outcomes. But its impact varies by income level (Freeman et al., 2020; Ranabhat et al., 2018). In Ethiopia, a low-income country, political instability worsens health inequities and lowers life expectancy. Ethiopia's history of political turmoil and weak governance has disrupted healthcare services and limited access to essential resources. In contrast, in the United States, a high-income country, life expectancy remains relatively stable despite political instability. This stability is due to a robust healthcare system, significant healthcare spending, and advanced medical technology, which help mitigate the negative effects of political instability (Ranabhat et al., 2018; Freeman et al., 2020).

**Perspective 2: The life necessaties factors associated with life expectancy in a country show a similar correlation for all income groups.**

The second perspective focuses on life necessities, such as access to healthcare, sanitation and nutrition. Studies indicate a positive correlation between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy, with higher spending often leading to increased longevity, especially in developed countries. For instance, a 10% increase in per capita health expenditure can result in a gain of 3.5 months in life expectancy (Freeman et al., 2020). Additionally, socioeconomic factors such as education and income are strongly associated with life expectancy improvements across all income groups (Chen et al., 2021; Ranabhat et al., 2018).


This study aims to illuminate how life necessities and political factors show varrying relationships with life expectancy across different income groups.
